Wis3D: A web-based 3D visualization tool for 3D computer vision
================================================================

Wis3D is a tool for providing the visualization and tooling needed during the 3D machine learning workflow. 
It enables visualizing and interaction with 3D objects and keypoint correspondences in Web browsers. 
The visualizer contains works like `Tensorboard <https://www.tensorflow.org/tensorboard>`_, but mainly for 3D visualization.

**Core features of Wis3D include:**

* 3D visualization and interaction, supports the following types:
  
  * mesh
  * point cloud
  * camera pose
  * ray
  * image
  * box
  * sphere
  * line
  * camera trajectory
  * voxel grid

* Keypoint correspondences visualization
* Time-varying data visualization with 3D objects and keypoint correspondences


Wis3D is mainly composed of two parts, ``3D objects`` and ``Keypoint Correspondences``.
